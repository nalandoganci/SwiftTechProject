# SwiftTechProject
In this project, I’ve developed key components of a Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) program for a fictional tech company. I’ve identified compliance obligations, tailored a risk management policy, assessed infrastructure risks using common frameworks, and designed governance activities to ensure effective security controls. This project demonstrates my ability to interpret business strategy in terms of risk management and enhance a business’s security posture through GRC principles.
